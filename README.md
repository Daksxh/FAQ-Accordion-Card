## About This Project

<p>This challenge was to build out an FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

<br>
<br>
Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
3. Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
4. Bonus: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript</p>
<br>
<br>



## Built with

<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

## What I learned
- My first Frontendmentor challenge using Javascript!
- I had difficulty getting the orange block and the woman at the computer images to position correctly. I used negative margins and absolute positioning.
